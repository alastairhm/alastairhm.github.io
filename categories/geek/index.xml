One of the tasks I set myself was to write a Joke bot for Mastodon, which work out to be fairly easy with a couple of packages got and masto.
Dad Joke Bot the code is only 32 lines long, looking to expand it to be able to post images as well.</description></item><item><title>Python icecream debug</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/python_icecream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:58:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/python_icecream/</guid><description>Icecream Debug Do you ever use print() or log() to debug your code? Of course you do. IceCream, or ic for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.
ic() is like print(), but better.

Numbers It took a while searching about on the internet and some head scratching to find a library and work out what connected to what on the Pico.
This is what I found, and worked out.
TFT Board Raspberry Pi Pin LED 3v3(Out) SCK GP10 SDA GP11 AO/DC GP16 Reset GP17 CS GP18 GND GND VCC VBUS 5V Using that information I was able to put together this library based on a few others I found and a few test programs.</description></item><item><title>Small LED Matrix Numbers</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 15:16:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico7/</guid><description>Something I did a few (8) years ago on the Arduino to display two-digit numbers on a 8x8 LED matrix, this is an update to do the same in Micropthon.
Numbers have been defined to 3x5 pixels, so for a two-digit number it fits into 8x5 LED grid with spacing, saving some LED Matrix space.
Numbers The code for this can be found here numbers.py
This original Arduino code is here.</description></item><item><title>DHT11 Sensor in Micropython</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:39:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico6/</guid><description>Just a short bit of code to test a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor module.
This version has just three pins VCC, GND and data, so easy to connect and use with the DHT library.

This is an example why I love open source. The original library I found was functional but sparse, last committed to 4 years ago. There were a few forks, most not much activity. One had been active recently and had some major improvements in functionality so switched over to that fork.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Pico W Mandelbrot Set</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 12:29:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico4/</guid><description>Stumbled across a Python script to run a Mandelbrot set in ASCII in Python so I thought I would see how it ran on the RaspberryPi Pico.
After tweaking it slightly from the source it ended up like this mandelbrot.py

First with the internal temperature sensor and then using a TMP36 temperature sensor externally.
I wrote two classes to access these and return the reading.
Internal Temperature External Temperature Here is an example using the two sensors together temps.py
You will need to upload the two classes to the Pico first in a library sub-directory.
Here is how you would wire it up on a breadboard tmp36.</description></item><item><title>Rasberry Pi Pico W OLED</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:38:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/pico2/</guid><description>Some components arrived from AliExpress recently so been able to play with an I2C OLED display with my Pico W.

https://github.com/alastairhm/searchit
It uses the Python Library Fire to automatically generate the command line interface which is something I stumbled across recently.
You either pass it a paramater for the search term or if one it not passed it used whatever is in your clipboard buffet.</description></item><item><title>Learn C on Linux</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/learnc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 10:35:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/learnc/</guid><description>Came across this article of ways to Learn C on Linux which took me back to my 3rd real programming job.
It was with a software house mainly working with C/C++ on Linux/ Unix and embedded systems.
My first real experience use C/C++ in a professional environment, happy days with a good bunch of geeks.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never tried it before it would be a good change from more recent languages to learn C for a challenge.</description></item><item><title>6502 Assembly Language</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/6502/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2020 16:54:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/6502/</guid><description>Been trying to relearn 6502 assembly language for fun, its a lot faster and easier than the first time on actual hardware when I was a teenager.
