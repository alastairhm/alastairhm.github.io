It uses the Python Library Fire to automatically generate the command line interface which is something I stumbled across recently.
You either pass it a paramater for the search term or if one it not passed it used whatever is in your clipboard buffet.</description></item><item><title>Processing</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/processing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 09:55:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/processing/</guid><description>Make learning programming fun It is funny how things come around again, when I started learning to programming back in the 1980s on my 8 bit machines (ZX81, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro) I used to play with graphics a lot. It gave instant feedback and visually showed the results of things like recursion. I had great fun playing with Fractals and other procedural generated images.
Recently I discovered a YouTube channel and programming platform which took me right back to those days.</description></item></channel></rss>
