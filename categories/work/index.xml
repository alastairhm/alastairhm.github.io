Looking forward to the new challenge but also sad to say goodbye to my co-workers who have been on the journey with me since I started at William Hill back in November 2011.
I have certainly grown and learned a lot at my time at William Hill and am grateful for all the opportunities they provided with me to improve.</description></item></channel></rss>
