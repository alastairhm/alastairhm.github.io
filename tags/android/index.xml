Markor it has a Hugo template to use for blank documents which is useful.
It&amp;rsquo;s on FDroid so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to install o on my kindle as well.
Then use Github website to upload the new file to my Hugo blog repo.</description></item><item><title>Posting from Android 2</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/phone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 17:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/phone/</guid><description>Testing github Web upload.

First trial not so good.
Wondering if its an issue with having MFA enabled on my Github account, although using my personal access token instead of the password should work I would have thought.
I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted an issue on their Github page, so wait and see what they say about it.</description></item><item><title>Posting from Android</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/android_posts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/android_posts/</guid><description>Trying to think of a way to be able to post content from my Android devices (phone/ Fire Tablet).
Basically would need just the following;
Text editor for creating markdown for the post. Git to checkout, commit and push updates to GitHub. My Travis CI pipeline would then handle the publishing.
Finding a text editor app isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem there are any number of them on both Google Play and Amazon Kindle stores which could be used.</description></item></channel></rss>
