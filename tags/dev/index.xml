Been using a book I picked up from eBay Discovering BBC Micro Machine Code by A.P. Stephenson
Using BeebAsm assembler on my Mac with a BBC Micro emulator, rather than build in BBC BASIC one.
You can find my code at Github https://github.com/alastairhm/beebasm</description></item><item><title>Processing</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/processing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 09:55:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/processing/</guid><description>Make learning programming fun It is funny how things come around again, when I started learning to programming back in the 1980s on my 8 bit machines (ZX81, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro) I used to play with graphics a lot. It gave instant feedback and visually showed the results of things like recursion. I had great fun playing with Fractals and other procedural generated images.
Recently I discovered a YouTube channel and programming platform which took me right back to those days.</description></item><item><title>Acorn Electron Sound Mod</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/acornmod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:31:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/acornmod/</guid><description>Interest video about modding the Acorn Electron.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Lbry Shortcode</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/lbry_shortcode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 13:50:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/lbry_shortcode/</guid><description>One thing I like about Hugo is how easy it is to expand its functionality with your own code.
For example was able to create a shortcode to embed Lbry.tv videos into a post in around five minutes.
First I created an empty file layouts/shortcodes/lbry.html which I pasted the basic embed code take from the share button on one of their videos.
&amp;lt;iframe id=&amp;#34;lbry-iframe&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;560&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;315&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;https://lbry.tv/$/embed/this-new-fedora-powered-thinkpad-p53-is/097106eb68aebc90b33d83bb053467af942a8e20&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; Then parameterized this so that the src url can be changed.</description></item></channel></rss>
