First trial not so good.
Wondering if its an issue with having MFA enabled on my Github account, although using my personal access token instead of the password should work I would have thought.
I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted an issue on their Github page, so wait and see what they say about it.</description></item><item><title>Posting from Android</title><link>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/android_posts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.0x32.co.uk/posts/android_posts/</guid><description>Trying to think of a way to be able to post content from my Android devices (phone/ Fire Tablet).
Basically would need just the following;
Text editor for creating markdown for the post. Git to checkout, commit and push updates to GitHub. My Travis CI pipeline would then handle the publishing.
Finding a text editor app isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem there are any number of them on both Google Play and Amazon Kindle stores which could be used.</description></item></channel></rss>
